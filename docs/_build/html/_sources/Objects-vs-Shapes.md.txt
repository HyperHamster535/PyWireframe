# Objects or Shapes - which should you use?

## What's the difference?

The difference between an [object](https://github.com/HyperHamster535/PyWireframe/wiki/Objects) and a [shape](https://github.com/HyperHamster535/PyWireframe/wiki/Shapes) is that an object re-renders every time you `refresh`, whereas a shape vanishes.

## Which one should I use?

### When to use an object
You would use an object for something that is permanently in one place.

### When to use a shape
You would use a shape for something that is only going to be visible for one frame.
